# Misinformatiom-Disinformation_Detection
# Overview
This project is dedicated to developing a text-based offensive content detection system tailored to specific language and cultural contexts. It employs advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify and moderate offensive content on online platforms. While the current scope is limited to text data, future work will expand to include multilingual capabilities and support for audio and video analysis.
# Key Features
Text-Based Detection: Focuses exclusively on detecting offensive content in textual data.
Scalable Architecture: Designed for seamless integration with online platforms such as social media and forums.
Future-Ready Design: Planned enhancements include multilingual support and audio/video processing.
# Objectives


1. Develop a robust dataset of text content specific to a single language and cultural context.
2. Train and fine-tune deep learning models for high accuracy in offensive content detection.
3. Deploy a real-time text-based detection system with a user-friendly interface.
4. Lay the groundwork for future multilingual and multimodal (audio/video) capabilities.
# Technologies Used
Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or JAX

NLP Models: BERT, CNN

Backend: Python
# Future Enhancements
Support for multilingual datasets (e.g., Amharic, Afaan Oromoo, English).
Integration of audio and video analysis for multimodal offensive content detection.
